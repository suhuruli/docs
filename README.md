# Welcome to Spice.ai

**Spice.ai** is a data and time-series AI application platform; an AI-backend-as-a-service comprising of composable, ready-to-use data and AI building blocks, including a managed [Spice.ai OSS](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai) service, and  preloaded with 100TB+ of ready-to-use data.

This is the Spice.ai Cloud Platform documentation. If you are looking for Spice.ai OSS documentation please visit [docs.spiceai.org](https://docs.spiceai.org).

Spice.ai connects real-time and historical time-series data, federated SQL query, ETL, serverless compute, machine learning training and inferencing, in a unified cloud platform and developer-focused community hub.

**Operating data and AI infrastructure can be painful.**&#x20;

ðŸ˜“ Query data from many sources and backends.

ðŸ˜“ Maintain expensive and often error prone ETL, data, query, and ML infrastructure.

ðŸ˜“ Constantly monitor data, training, and inferencing for errors, correctness, changes, and bottlenecks.

ðŸ˜“ Comply with governance, compliance, and privacy concerns.

**Spice.ai makes it easy.**

With **Spice.ai,** you can:

* Query real-time and historical data **using SQL** in seconds and fetch results in **JSON** or **Apache Arrow** for use with applications, ML, or libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas**.
* Collaborate on datasets and ML models in one place through the new community-centric developer hub.
* Create, fork, and curate your own hosted datasets and ML models to share and build with the community indexed by the Spice.ai package manager, [spicerack.org](https://spicerack.org).
* Define and manage custom datasets in GitHub along with your application code.
* Bring and federate your own data or leverage 100TB+ of preloaded community data.

Spice.ai is preloaded with community data from ecosystems including **Ethereum**, **Bitcoin,** and **EigenLayer** along with enriched datasets for NFTs, DeFi, DEXs, ENS, Asset Prices, and more. Most datasets are open-source and available at [github.com/spiceai/datasets](https://github.com/spiceai/datasets).

Building blocks available in the Spice.ai platform today include:

* Petabyte-scale Cloud Data Platform
* [Datasets and Views](building-blocks/datasets-and-views.md)
* [Spice Firecache](building-blocks/spice-firecache/) (managed Spice.ai OSS)
* [ML Models](building-blocks/spice-models.md) (in Preview)
* [AI Predictions](api/predictions/) (in Preview)
* [Hosted Blockchain Nodes](building-blocks/blockchain-nodes.md)
* Community Data including [Blockchain Data](building-blocks/datasets.md)
