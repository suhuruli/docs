# End User License Agreement

Last updated: September 13, 2023

This End User License Agreement (this "Agreement") concerns the Spice AI platform, as described at [spice.ai](https://spice.ai), provided to you by Spice AI, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company"), as well as related websites, mobile applications, products, and services we may offer to you, including updates, any online services, or downloads associated herewith, the software (including firmware) for any related peripherals, and the associated media, printed materials, and documentation (collectively, “Program”).

You represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts (e.g., you are not a minor). If you are entering into this Agreement for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent to us that you have legal authority to access the Program in accordance with this Agreement. By using the Program or “clicking to accept,” you accept the terms of this Agreement with Company. If you do not agree to these terms, you are not permitted to install, copy, or use the Program. To reject these terms, you must not “click to accept” these terms or install, copy, or use the Program.

This Agreement is supplemental to the Spice AI [Website Terms of Use](broken-reference) and [Privacy Policy](privacy.md), which outlines your rights and obligations regarding general website use and privacy considerations, including any user-generated content you and other users may share while using the Program (“**User Content**”). The terms and conditions of the Website Terms of Use and Privacy Policy are incorporated herein by reference and deemed part of this Agreement.

Except for Section 13 (regarding Jurisdiction and Applicable Law), Company reserves the right to modify this Agreement at any time by any means, including without limitation by (1) posting the modifications to [spice.ai](https://spice.ai)/[spice.ai](https://spice.ai) and/or (2) requiring you to “click to accept” the modified Agreement. By continuing to use the Program, you accept any and all modifications to this Agreement. If modifications to the Agreement are unacceptable to you or cause you to no longer be in compliance with this Agreement, you must terminate, and immediately stop using, the Program. If any future modifications are implemented as a “click to accept” Agreement, you may not be able to continue using the Program unless you affirmatively accept the modified Agreement.

**1. Limited Use License.** Subject to and conditional upon your strict compliance with all terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company grants you the non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to access and use the Program solely for its intended purpose. All rights not specifically granted are reserved by Company. This Agreement shall also apply to updates to the Program that may be provided to you by the Company, provided that such update may be accompanied by additional terms.  You acknowledge and agree that, other than the license granted to you by this Agreement, you shall have no ownership or property interest in any product or service-provided content (as defined below).

**2. License Conditions.** This license is subject to the limitations outlined in this Section. Any use of the Program in violation of these limitations will result in an immediate termination of your license and continued use of the Program will be an infringement of Company's rights in and to the Program.

(a)   use the Program beyond the scope of the license granted under Section 1;

(b)  provide any other person, including any subcontractor, independent contractor, affiliate, or service provider, with access to or use of the Program;

(g)  copy the Program, in whole or in part;

(h)  rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense, assign, distribute, publish, transfer, or otherwise make available the Program, or any features or functionality of the Program, to any Third Party for any reason, whether or not over a network or on a hosted basis, including in connection with the internet or any web hosting, wide area network (WAN), virtual private network (VPN), virtualization, time-sharing, service bureau, software as a service, cloud, or other technology or service;

(i)    use the Program in violation of any law, regulation, or rule; or

(j)    use the Program for purposes of competitive analysis of the Program, the development of a competing software product or service, or any other purpose that is to the Company's commercial disadvantage.

All rights granted to you under this Agreement (including your use of the software in the Program) will terminate immediately in the event that you are in breach of any of the terms or do anything with any software in the Program that is not expressly permitted by this Agreement.

You agree not to do any of the following actions while using the Program:

Third-Party Materials.** The Program may include software, content, data, or other materials, including related documentation, that are owned by entities other than Company and that are provided to you on licensee terms that are in addition to and/or different from those contained in this Agreement ("Third-Party Licenses"). A list of all materials, if any, included in the Program and provided under Third-Party Licenses is set forth on Schedule A to this Agreement, and the applicable Third-Party Licenses are accessible via links therefrom. You are bound by and shall comply with all Third-Party Licenses. Any breach by you of any Third-Party License is also a breach of this Agreement.

**4. Open Source Software.** The Program may include certain open source components that are subject to open source licenses (“Open Source Software”), in which case, the embedded Open Source Software is owned by a third party. The Open Source Software is not subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Instead, each item of Open Source Software is licensed under its applicable license terms which accompanies such Open Source Software. Nothing in this Agreement limits Customer’s rights under, nor grants Customer rights that supersede, the terms and conditions of any applicable license terms for the Open Source Software.

**5. Collection and Use of Information.** Subject to Company’s Privacy Policy, you acknowledge that Company may, directly or indirectly through the services of third parties, collect and store information regarding use of the Program through which it otherwise is accessed and used, through:

(b)  security measures included in the Program.&#x20;

You agree that Company may use such information for any purpose related to your use of the Program including but not limited to:

(b)  verifying your compliance with the terms of this Agreement and enforcing Company’s rights, including all Intellectual Property Rights in and to the Program.

**6. Intellectual Property Rights.** You acknowledge and agree that access to the Program is provided under a license, and not sold, to you. You do not acquire any ownership interest in the Program under this Agreement, or any other rights thereto, other than to use the same in accordance with the license granted and subject to all terms, conditions, and restrictions under this Agreement. The Company reserves and shall retain its entire right, title, and interest in and to the Program and all Intellectual Property Rights arising out of or relating to the Program, except as expressly granted to you in this Agreement. You shall use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the Program from infringement, misappropriation, theft, misuse, or unauthorized access.

**8. Termination.** Without prejudice to any other rights of Company, this Agreement will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms and conditions. In the event of termination for this reason, in addition to Company revoking your access to the Program, you must destroy all copies of the Program and all of its component parts.

**13. Jurisdiction and Applicable Law.** Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Program, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Company, will be adjudicated in the federal and/or state courts located in the County of King in the State of Washington, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts.  The laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to its conflict of law rules, govern this Agreement and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and us.
