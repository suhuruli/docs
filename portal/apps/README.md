# Apps

**Apps** are self-contained sets of SQL, datasets, monitoring, and configuration that run on the Spice.ai platform.

Each app has a unique API Key and can be owned by individual accounts or [**organizations**](../../getting-started/core-concepts/organizations.md).

### Learn how to:

* [Transfer an app to another organization](app-transfer.md)
* [Connect an app with your existing GitHub repository](connect-github-repository.md)
* [Create and toggle custom Dataset and Views](../../building-blocks/datasets-and-views.md)
